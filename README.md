Project Name: LSFR 

Project Description: In such times, we all need a friend as we are always confined in our homes. The project we created as a team is “the box” which serves as a friend. Our idea is that our product is created with the integration of technology and artificial intelligence from a company named LSFR. This name is a byproduct of the team’s first name initials. The product aims to provide the community with a friend that can aid them and be there for them through their times in need or even share with them their moments of bliss. In our website, our purpose was to showcase the interactions with the box and advertise for the product on an international scope. The experience we strived for is to create a lighthearted experience through a platform that has a friendly tone and mood. 

Process: For the concept implementation, I started out by being responsible to create the product which is “the box”. By getting seven cubes of plain Styrofoam, I started painting them using water paint colors that gives a friendly tone. For the colors, I discussed with my team and as soon as we finalized the color palette, I started. I had to mix several colors to get the exact color as the sample palette of colors from the web. After that, I had to wait for hours until the first coat of paint gets dry to repaint it again in order to intensify the vibrancy of the colors. To add more to the aesthetic of the box, I wanted to create like a shadow circle that acts as a light reflection. I did that by drawing a circle by the use of white glue and then I added to it while it is still wet some white sand and glitter. After that, we all started with writing our scripts as we needed to have them ready before film shooting. When writing my script, I decided to do it by Arabic to advocate that the product shall be advertised internationally. In terms of the script, I had to think of a story that is personal and make the product feel like a home product. Moreover, it was interesting and challenging as I wrote my script in English, cause then I had to translate it to Arabic. I am more comfortable with speaking in English yet trying to do it in Arabic is an opportunity that challenged me and push me outside my comfort zone. For the shooting, we filmed using an iPhone and we tried our best to shoot the scenes in the best angles possible. We had to reshoot numerous times, perhaps over 10 times until we got the best one. Shooting each film took approximately three hours without any modifications. In terms of the audio for the film, we did a separate voice over for it to be clearer and in sync. At the same time, we asked two friends who were doing the voice over for the box, to say three lines for the preview in English, Arabic, and French. The aim is to complement our idea of creating a sense of diversity. All the film editing, cutting or etc. was done through the App Davinci Resolve which is a color correction and a non-linear video editing application. On the other hand, I was responsible for the content that is displayed on the web. It was a pleasure as I got to enhance my skills in writing scripts and storytelling. For the icon images that are on the website, it was found on the internet; however, I changed their colors to suit our website by using Adobe Photoshop then exported the images to my team members. Moreover, I can profoundly say that filming and photography was an exciting and a beneficial experience. In the process of taking pictures, I learned to shoot in the same direction of where the natural light hits for a decent quality. 

Reflection/ Evaluation: The initial concept of the project was to create a product “the box” that will be a friend to people and also a home device. The aim was to advertise for it, and I believe we did well in implementing that through the film. In terms of idea and theme, our goals and expectations were clearly met. This is vivid through the color palette and the overall design of our website. In terms of film, I am very satisfied with the angles captured as well as the audio quality, and how well they operate together. In addition to that, the background music was chosen to affect behavioral and emotional responses to the scene. I can confidently confirm that, as a team, we are proud of all the hard work put into the project. Truly a memorable experience that made me explore and learn more in unexplored fields. It is an experience to be cherished. However, some challenges were surely faced. It gave us the opportunity to delve deeper into the task. For example, the process of implementing the website caused some complications. Trying to implement the box images as a slideshow crashes other pages, so we decided to display the best images we captured. Another difficulty faced is publishing it into GitHub because our video has a large MB size. To counter that, we decided to upload it to vimeo, then publish it to GitHub.  All in all, it was an experience that is one of a kind, and the interactions formed allowed me to see how a team could work together to give their best.
