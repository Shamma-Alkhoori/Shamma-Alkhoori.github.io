Comix Strip 

As a group of students with different exposures, coming together virtually and collaboratively, creating a comix strip that narrates a story is exciting and beneficial in many aspects. Just the experience of helping each other put the words together into sentences for the dialogue boxes, creating images that deliver our message, and talking together enhances the way we think and even our communication skills. Truly thankful for such an opportunity :) It made me believe that "learning can be fun ". 

Project Name: A Pilot's Journey


Project Description: With the global Covid-19 pandemic turning our lives upside down and upends our familiar rhythms of life, awareness, and adaptation of a situation in advance can help all of us to become powerful agents of change to our communities. The Comix Strip "A Pilot's Journey" highlights the theme of how different countries handled the pandemic and the changes encountered as a byproduct of Covid-19. The purpose is not to joke around about what's happening but to manifest people's wrong behavior towards the pandemic and give an insight into how countries were positively affected by it. It's the need to communicate with others narratively while appealing to them by creating a heartfelt experience. The inspiration is to generate a comix strip that showcases the Covid-19 spread and seriousness of such a pandemic. Also, it's an emphasis to be effective; communication must be fascinating and engaging. In other words, it's a response to the current pandemic by using comics to produce innovative communication medium. 

Process: The process of completion was long, but worth the time spent. As a group, we all learned by bringing our individualistic skills altogether to design a comix strip. We divided the work into two aspects to aid us in the work implementation along the journey. Among the four members, two were responsible for the technical part "codes," and the other two were responsible for the visual "image creation" and story narration. I was part of the second one. My partner and I have divided the work equally. Each one was supposed to create three complete individual panels, each representing a different country with other elements. We started by sketching them on paper to draft how they should look like when being created. Being in charge of image creation by the usage of Adobe Illustrator was quite exciting and challenging at the same time. When tracing the images, I repeated the phrase "TRUST THE PROCESS" to have a clear mindset to keep on pushing and that eventually, I'll reach to what I want. At first, it took plenty of hours to get its grip and feel comfortable using Adobe Illustrator tools. Seeking out the precision of image tracing was a bit hectic; however, the more I practiced, the more confident I became. Finally, when done, it all looked smooth and satisfactory to what we had in mind. Also, I was surprised that I enjoyed the process as it made me learn new skills and nourish them along the way and get out of my comfort zone.  The experience allowed me to explore my artistic side and try to blend my style with my partner's style. As people from different backgrounds, we both have a different outlook on the representation of an image.

Reflection/Evaluation: The comix strip's initial concept was to demonstrate the response of each country to Covid-19. It is supposed to create a heartfelt experience in a reachable form, which is comical humor. I believe that our expectations were at most reached, regardless of the challenges and difficulties that came along the journey of moving sequential arts to the web page's dynamic space. However, speaking in terms of Image creation, choosing and determining the final colors to be used as a challenge, especially a background color, is responsible for grabbing the user's attention and smooth transitions between panels. Other than that, moving the images from Adobe Illustrator to the web by coding has shown issues that were not visible in Adobe Illustrator. That was a significant issue that resulted in multiple image alterations. Moreover, another problem occurred when uploading the web to GitHub, even though we checked the resolution. Also, the js/CSS files were all appropriately linked. On the contrary, in the end, we were all pleased with how it came out, knowing how much we all pushed each other and worked hard to produce what was at first only an idea.
